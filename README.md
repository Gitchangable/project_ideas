# Project Ideas Showcase

Below are three potential directions for our upcoming project. **All** have valid use cases, but some offer deeper features than others. The final choice depends on how far we want to push for an advanced (A-level) solution.

## 1. Smart Indoor Garden System

**Overview:**  
A **robust**, cloud-connected IoT system that monitors and optimizes plant health. Perfect for those seeking a **truly advanced** project with **multiple integrated features** and **clear sustainability impacts**.

### Main Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity, all in a centralized dashboard.  
- **Automated Irrigation & Lighting:** Advanced logic triggers water pumps or grow lights to minimize resource usage.  
- **Adaptive Algorithms:** Predictive analytics for water schedules and user-friendly notifications when attention is needed.  
- **User Authentication:** Seamless login/logout and secure profile management.  
- **Scalability:** Additional sensors or expansions (e.g., fertilizer dispensing) can be integrated for a truly **full-featured** system.

> **Sustainability Focus:** Encourages responsible water and energy consumption (aligns with [SDG 12](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/) and [SDG 6](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/)).  
> **Complexity Level:** ***High*** – multiple hardware/software integrations plus advanced data analytics.

## 2. Public Car Park with Basic Sensor System

**Overview:**  
A straightforward approach where each parking spot has a basic sensor to detect occupancy, providing a color-coded status (red, yellow, green). While it can help minimize needless driving around and searching for spots, it may **need further expansion** to reach advanced levels.

### Current Features
- **Spot Detection:** Distinguishes between free, reserved, or taken.  
- **Visual Indicators:** Basic grid-based interface with minimal overhead.  
- **Potential for Real-Time Updates:** Could show occupancy in a web dashboard.

> **Sustainability Angle:** Reduces driving time in parking lots, which can cut emissions.  
> **Complexity Level:** ***Currently Low*** – the concept is functional, but primarily involves simple sensor logic and a minimal UI. Additional modules could be added to increase complexity.

> **Note:** Some might find it beneficial to **explore advanced expansions** (e.g., reservation systems, automated navigation, or dynamic pricing) to meet the robust criteria required for A-level success.

## 3. EcoBudget App

**Overview:**  
An **all-in-one** budget tracker integrated with **sustainability metrics**. It tackles personal finance alongside IoT-style insights into energy and water usage. This approach can **seamlessly** combine advanced data analytics, real-time resource consumption, and user-driven financial goals.

### Main Features
- **Expense Tracker:** Add and categorize daily expenses with thorough data visualization (graphs, charts).  
- **IoT Monitor:** Simulated or real sensor data for energy/water usage. Sync with a cloud-based system to reveal consumption trends alongside personal spending.  
- **Sustainability Insights:** Built-in “green tips” and monthly goal suggestions (e.g., reducing unnecessary costs related to utilities).  
- **User Profiles & Authentication:** Secure sign-in, multi-user access, personalized dashboards.  
- **Analytics & Alerts:** Generate periodic or real-time alerts whenever spending/consumption patterns stray from defined eco-friendly goals.

> **Sustainability Focus:** Addresses responsible consumption in **both** finances and resource usage (aligns with [SDG 12](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/)).  
> **Complexity Level:** ***High*** – especially when combining budgeting, authentication, and IoT data streams into one cohesive app.

## Comparison & Final Thoughts

| Project    | Sustainability Scope    | Technical Complexity | Potential for A-Level |
|------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Garden** | Water & energy saving   | **High** (IoT, automation, data analytics) | **Very High** |
| **Parking**| Emission reduction      | Low (basic sensor + minimal UI) | Currently **Limited** |
| **Budget** | Resource & cost tracking| **High** (expense mgmt + IoT usage + tips) | **Very High** |

Each idea can be **expanded** to fit the needs of this project. However, if **advanced** functionality, sustainability impact, and maximum complexity are key factors, the **Garden** or **EcoBudget** proposals may lend themselves more readily to a high-tier solution. The Parking Sensor concept, as it stands, has **fewer** integrated features and would need **substantial enhancements** before it reaches similar levels of depth.
